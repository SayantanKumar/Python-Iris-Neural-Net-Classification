# Iris-NN
A simple program to classify the 3 flowers using a Neural Network with supervised learning using data from the Iris Dataset.

This is my first machine learning program so feel free to improve, and I'll love some constructive criticism

There will be an Jupyter Notebook as well as a plain python file here.



# Dependencies (Or just use anaconda) :

Numpy

Sklearn (Just to get the dataset)

Scipy (For optimization)
