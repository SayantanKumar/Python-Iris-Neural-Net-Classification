# Iris-NN
A simple program that uses the iris dataset to train a dataset that, based on the 4 inputs, can predict one of the 3 flower's


# Demos
The program can be run alone to run the main demo which trains the net, graphs the training then outputs the predicted based on values coded.

If it is imported other demos can be ran:
inp() - Trains the net, then returns the prediction based on 4 values that are inputted
training() - Trains the net 1 iteration at a time at how many iterations you want, showing an interactive graph as it goes along
Or you can create your own code to interact with the net



# Dependencies (Although I suggest to install Anaconda):

Numpy (Handling the data)

Sklearn (Get the dataset)

Scipy (Using the wrapper for the BFGS algorithm)

Matplotlib (Graphing)
