# Iris-NN
A simple program to classify the 3 flowers using a Neural Network with supervised learning using data from the Iris Dataset.

This is my first machine learning program so feel free to improve the code, and an explanation to what you did and why would be very welcome too!

There is both a Jupyter Notebook as well as a plain .py file from the notebook so that isn't formatted very well.



# Dependencies (Or just use anaconda) :

Numpy

Sklearn (Just to get the dataset)

Scipy (For optimization)
