# Iris-NN
Neural Network for the Iris Dataset using python.

My first full neural network program using the famous iris data set. Feel free to fork and improve my program, I'm still learning so there's going to be a lot to improve...

There will be an Jupyter Notebook as well as a plain python file here.



# Dependencies (Or just use anaconda) :

Numpy

Sklearn (Just to get the dataset)
