# Iris-NN
Neural Network for the Iris Dataset using python.

My first full neural network program using the famous iris data set. Feel free to fork and improve my program, I'm still learning so there's going to be a lot to improve...



# Dependencies (Or just use anaconda) :

Numpy

Sklearn (Just to get the dataset)
